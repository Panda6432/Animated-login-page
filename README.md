This project is an Animated Login Page designed to provide a visually engaging and festive user experience. The page combines a responsive login form with delightful animated elements, creating a unique interface suitable for holiday-themed websites or seasonal applications.

Features:
Responsive Login Form:

A fully responsive login form with a modern design.
Includes input fields for username and password, a "Remember Me" option, and a "Forgot Password" link.
Styled with a glassmorphic effect, featuring a transparent background and smooth edges for a clean look.

Snowfall Animation:
Realistic animated snowfall in the background, adding to the winter and festive ambiance.
Snowflakes of varying sizes and speeds fall continuously, creating a dynamic and immersive effect.
Implemented using CSS animations for smooth performance.

Santa Animation:
A festive Santa PNG image moves horizontally across the screen.
The Santa transitions from left to right, rotates when off-screen, and reappears from the opposite side, adding a playful touch.
The animation is fluid, with the rotation happening outside the visible area to maintain a natural flow.

Interactive Background:
The background features a static winter-themed image that complements the snowfall animation.
The interplay between the static and dynamic elements enhances the overall aesthetic appeal.

Performance Optimizations:
Lightweight CSS animations ensure smooth performance without overwhelming system resources.
Proper layering of elements to avoid interference between animations and the login form.

Use Cases:
Perfect for websites or web applications celebrating winter or festive events.
Suitable for educational, commercial, or personal projects aiming to create an engaging user experience.
Can serve as an inspiration or base for creating customized animated web pages.

Technology Stack:
HTML5: For structuring the page and its elements.
CSS3: For styling, animations, and creating the snowfall and Santa effects.
JavaScript (optional): For additional interactivity (if required).
